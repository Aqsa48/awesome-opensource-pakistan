If you don't have git installed in your machine, [install it](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the clone button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/this-is-you/awesome-opensource-pakistan.git
```

where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository in GitHub to your computer.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd awesome-opensource-pakistan
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b <add-your-new-branch-name>
```

For example:

```
git checkout -b feature_22_header_page
or
git checkout -b bug_15_missing_image
```

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

<img align="right" width="450" src="images/git-status.png" alt="git status" />

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add .
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "fixed#{issue#} <your-message>"
```

replace {issue#} with the issue number you are working.

replace `<your-message>` with description of what you have changed.

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```

replace `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review

Now if you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.
